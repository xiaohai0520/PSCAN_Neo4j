# pSCAN - Fast and Exact Structural Graph Clustering (Java on Neo4j)

The paper: *["pSCAN: Fast and Exact Structural Graph Clustering"](https://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~ljchang/pdf/icde16-pscan.pdf) by Lijun Chang, Wei Li, Xuemin Lin,Lu Qin and Wenjie Zhang, ICDE'16*.

This is the refactored version of the pScan with Java on the Neo4j.

# Deployment

The program depends on the graph database Neo4j. *[Here is the link for Neo4j on the github](https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j)*


# Usage

```
Clusters unweighted undirected input network (graph) considering overlaps and
building Exact Structural Graph

Usage: RUN_PSCAN [OPTIONS]... [input_network]...

input_network  - the input graph specified as a file in the TXT type.

  -inputnetwork        Path of the data file.
  -outputnetwork       Mode of the graph database.
  -eps                 The threshold of the similar for the clusters.
  -miu                 The least number for the clusters.
```
For example
```
$java RUN_PSCAN ./data/data.txt ./model 0.51 4

```

## Input
The undirected unweighted input network to be clustered is specified in the TXT format files:


```
# Example Network
# Nodes number  
9
# Note that the links in the database
0 1
0 2
2 1
```
## Output
The CNL (clusters nodes list) output is a standard format. For example:
```
eps: 0.51  miu:4

All nodes:
[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Core clusters:
[0,1,2,3],[5,6,7,8]

non cores:
[4,9]

All clusters:
No1: [0,1,2,3,4]
No2: [4,5,6,7,8,9]

```

# Analysis

## Influence
We do the test for running time on different parameters to test the influence for parameters.

## Optimization
We implement three optimizations in the pSCAN.

### cross link
- Cut half of the calculate times in process of checking core.
### Pruning rule 
- Find out which vertex pairs are not structure similar before checking.
### Adaptive structure-similar checking 
- Compute the minimum number of common neighbors, terminate early if any vertex can match the minimum condition.
